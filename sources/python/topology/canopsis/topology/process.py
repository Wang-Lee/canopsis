"""
Module in charge of defining main topological rules.

When an event occured, the related entity is retrieved and all bound
topological nodes are retrieved as well in order to execute theirs rules.

First, a topology processing is triggered when an event occured.

From this event, bound topology nodes are got in order to apply node rules.

A typical topological rule condition is an ``canopsis.rule.condition.all``
composed of the ``canopsis.topology.process.new_state`` condition.
If this condition is checked, then other specific conditions can be applied
such as::
    - ``canopsis.topology.process.condition``
    - ``canopsis.topology.process.all``
    - ``canopsis.topology.process.any``

A topology rule use the condition ``new_state``

"""
Event processing rule module.

Provides tools to process event rules.

A rule is a couple of (condition, action) tasks where condition can be None.

A rule respects those types::

   - task: task to execute.
   - dict:
      + condition (optional): condition task to check.
      + action: action task to run if condition does not exist or is True.

A task uses a python function. Therefore it is possible to use an absolute
path or to register a function in rule tasks with the function/decorator
``register_task``. The related function must takes in parameter the ``event``
to process, a dict ``ctx`` which exists on a rule life and a ``**kwargs`` which
contains parameters filled related to task parameters and the rule api.

A task respects those types::
   - str: task path to execute.
   - dict:
      + task_path: task path to execute.
      + params: dict of task parameters.

For example, let ``my.my_condition`` and ``my.my_action`` respectively
custom condition and action.

A typical parameterized rule configuration is as follow:
{
    "condition": "my.my_condition",
    "action": "my.my_action"
}

Or this one if you have the parameter ``foo`` equals to 2 to use in the action:
{
    "condition": "my.my_condition",
    "action": {
        "task_path": "my.my_action",
        "params": {
            "foo": 2
        }
    }
}

Or even this one without condition and where the action is registered with the
name ``my_action``.

    "action": "my_action"

A topology aims to resolve root cause analysis in using a graph representing a system infrastructure, and in resolving impact problems.

It is a graph representing a part of a system architecture composed of Nodes which are technical and logical system components, such as services, servers, aggregation operators, etc.

In pratice, such graph configuration is proposed such as a graph modeling where nodes are binded with system infrastructure, and completed with operator rules.
